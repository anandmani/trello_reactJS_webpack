# Kanban Board
A web application which is an imitation of a Trello Board. 
The project is a sophisticated scheduler allowing one to easily organize their daily tasks in the form of cards. These cards can be customised by adding descriptions, deadlines, colour-tags and team members.

The application was built using React.js
